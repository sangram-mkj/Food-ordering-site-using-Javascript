# Food-ordering-site-using-Javascript
Browse and search foods and add the to the cart. 


Used HTML, CSS and NodeJS to build this. It does an API call on page load and fetches foods which the user can add to cart if they like and in the cart page, the price always updates as you add new foods to cart.
